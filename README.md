# 2024 NYC Evictions Data Story

Overview/Findings
--
The story centers around the 12% increase in evictions across New York City and the possible impacts of 'good cause' eviction laws passed by the state in April 2024. The story shows that ultimately evictions continued to increase at a similar rate to before the law was passed and that Queens bore an oversized part of the increase. 

Goals
--
I hoped to make a original data-driven story that utilized Datawrapper. This was an assignment for our Data Studio class at Columbia Journalism School's Data Journalism program, intended to think about how to create end-to-end data stories about topics of our choosing on deadline.

Data Collection and Analysis
--
I found this dataset when searching through the [Data is Plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com/) archive. It's a [evergreen dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Evictions/6z8x-wfk4/about_data) which updates daily. I exported the data in early February and began exploring trends year over year, faceting by different categories. I wanted to see also how evictions progressed throughout the year for the past few years since I was also interested in the tenant protections. I did a cumulative sum compared year over year which showed the increase in evictions continued far beyond when the tenant laws were passed. 

Learnings
--
I learned in this project that sometimes simpler is better! Datawrapper makes design choices easy and quick while also allowing responsive design. Showing the change over months compared by year also took some interesting debate with line vs bar vs step charts being more or less effective in showing my point. I still think a bar chart showing the difference month over month for 2023 and 2024 could have made the point well, but I like the step chart for the additional information a reader can get like monthly sums and comparisons to post-COVID years.

I'd love to have been able to contextualize the fact that Queen saw such a large spike in 2024 by reaching out to sources and researchers -- I think it could use a bit more of a tie-in to the good cause angle as well.
